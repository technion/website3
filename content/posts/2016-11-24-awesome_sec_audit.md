# Awesome Sec Audit
This fully accredited security auditing service used by 500 of the Fortune 500 will fully audit your security environment.

Now, the recent move of this blog to the AMP standard broke this page. So as silly as it sounds, the only way this will load is if it's more than 600 pixels down the page.

As silly as this is, I've now experienced setting up a website on S3, and a Cloudfront CDN.

Kids, don't use AMP. Do however, scroll past this placeholder:

<amp-img
    src="/assets/images/placehold700.png"
    height="550"
    width="350"
    alt="A silly placeholder"
    layout="responsive"
    ></amp-img>


<amp-iframe width=600 height=200
    sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
    layout="responsive"
    frameborder="0"
    src="https://d86c84grgz45x.cloudfront.net/reactexample.html">
</amp-iframe>
