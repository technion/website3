### Introduction
This page has been rewritten following extensive communication with HP that occured following the disclosure made in this blog.

### Vulnerabilties and fixes
Everything you need to know is now covered in [HP's alert](https://h20564.www2.hpe.com/portal/site/hpsc/public/kb/docDisplay/?docId=emr_na-c03813919).

### Lefthand password generator
A second vulnerability not originally disclosed in this announcement was also fixed by HP. As this has been corrected, I have released [a key generator for the Lefthand/Storevirtual root password](https://github.com/technion/lhnskey).
